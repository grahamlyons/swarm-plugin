swarm-plugin
============

Jenkins Swarm plugin for self organizing slave nodes.

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=plugins/swarm-plugin)](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/plugins/job/swarm-plugin)

This plugin enables nodes to auto-discover a nearby Jenkins master and
join it automatically, thereby forming an ad-hoc cluster. Swarm makes it
easier to auto scale a Jenkins cluster by spinning up and tearing down
new nodes since no manual intervention required to make them join or leave the
cluster.
